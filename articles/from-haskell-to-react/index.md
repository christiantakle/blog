Take any tutorial out there. Spend a day learning, playing with Haskell. Or
Clojure. Or OCaml. Or even F#. Any language that puts pure functional construct
as first class citizens. If you never programmed with such a functional language
before, this will change your life of programmer. Not kidding. Do it now.

Then think about it. Understand it deeply. Learn about the [tail call
elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call) and about [function
purity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function). Compare the benefits and
drawbacks of the functional approach. Is it robust? Is it performant? Are you
functions *reasonable* -- easy to reason about? How does it compare to the
object-oriented programming world?

When you come back to Javascript, you’ll find yourself missing the power, the
expressivity, the composability of a functional language.

What is beautiful with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is precisely
that it makes components reasonable. Because they are autonomous self-entities
that do not depend on global state, you are in full control of their behavior.

WIP. Also, use [immutable-js](#). That’s how we make robust interfaces
nowadays.
