If you never programmed with a functional-pure language before, this will change
your life. Not kidding. Do it now. You'll for ever be a better programmer.

Take any tutorial out there. Spend a day learning, playing with Haskell. Or
Clojure. Or OCaml. I don’t care as long as it’s language that puts pure
functional construct as first class citizens.

Then think about it. Understand it deeply. Learn about the Tail Call
Optimization. Compare the benefits and drawbacks of the functional approach. Is
it robust? Is it performant? Are you functions *reasonable* -- easy to reason
about? How does it compare to the OO-programming world?

When you come back to Javascript, you’ll find yourself missing the power, the
expressivity, the composability of functional languages.

Use [immutable-js](#). Use [React](#). That’s how we make robust interfaces
nowadays.
