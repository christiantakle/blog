I got some time to upgrade my blog's tech (it was using something called "6to5",
the ancestor of [Babel](https://babeljs.io); good old times!), and I'll be
looking to try to post somewhat regularly in here; if only once every few
months.

As it happens, I've been working on infrastructure projects lately, and that
means I've been collecting quite a few tech' insights that I'm eager to share. A
large part of that comes from my job at Facebook, that led me to
work on [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/)â€™s packager.
The 'packager' is what compiles and bundles JavaScript together for React
Native. It is all made with JavaScript itself, for better or worse. More on that
later.

Besides, I've been playing on some C++ and OpenGL project, and while [shaving
the yak](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that.html) I
built a little build sytem, called `upd` (for "update"). It's similar to `make`
but with some extra convenience. I might publish properly it if I get the time
to make it nice. That was anyway a great learning experience for me, and a good
way to ramp up on C++ 14---last time I touched C++, version 11 was still being
worked on. I hope to document that experience, and make it a great codebase
to learn from.

Onwards!
